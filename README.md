# BLE-keyboard-using-Flex-sensors
Here I use Flex sensors, ESP 32 and ESP-32-BLE Keyboard library to create a ble keyboard. It replicates w,a,s,d,z,x keys of keyboard. 
I used a game to demonstrate working of keyboard using flex sensors. Some part of code is redundant which needs fixing. Also BLE nimble Library is used and 250ms calibration is the final working code.
