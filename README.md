# BLE-keyboard-using-Flex-sensors
Here I use Flex sensors, ESP 32 and ESP-32-BLE Keyboard library to create a ble keyboard. It replicates w,a,s,d,z,x keys of keyboard. Also some files used to main R&amp;D board are also included which is in BASIC language for ATmega 16 and used BASCOM-AVR which is used just for character transmission.
